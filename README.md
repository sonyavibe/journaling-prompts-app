# journaling-prompts-app-pet-project
a simple app that gets a random stoic quote using external API and gets you a prompt for daily journaling :)

:paperclips:you can play with it here: https://sonyavibe.github.io/journaling-prompts-app-pet-project/

the api sends a json object of a quote, and the app retrieves 2 data pieces: a quote itself and an author of this quote. if the authour value is empty, the app displays that the author is unknown, and if instead of a nice brief quote it send a whole paragraph of text, the app gently asks a user to refresh for another quote. it looks really simple, so i decided to add some spark to it! this is a js function generating random white sparkles and that was frankly the most challenging part of the whole app lol:

also, the app is fully responcive, so one can use it easily and comfortably from any device :)
