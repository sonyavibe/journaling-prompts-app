# journaling-prompts-app-pet-project
a simple app that gets a random philosophic quote from external API and gets you a prompt for daily journaling :) also there's a subtle sparkling animation effect in the background which i think looks very cool! <br><br>
here is a <b>quick demo</b>:<br><br>

the web-app is fully responsive and can adapt to mobile and tablet versions. here are <b>screenshots</b> of how it would look like on different devices:<br><br>

there's also a plan of adding an option for choosing background music and changing themes with the music, so i'll be updating this web-app!ðŸ˜Ž
